Styling for MDX content is handled via the mdx-components module, which provides a set of components for styling content. This sample MDX file demonstrates the styling of various HTML elements using the mdx-components module.

```typescript
    h1: (props) => <h1 className="text-4xl font-black pb-4" {...props} />,
    h2: (props) => <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold pb-4" {...props} />,
    p: (props) => <p className="text-lg pb-4" {...props} />,
```
